                            "We utilised and modified open-source code for implementing Frontier Exploration based SLAM. This allowed our Robot to explore frontiers on the generated map and keep going until the map is fully populated.",
                            "We then used YOLOv11 for our image recognition and counter, which uses the /odom topic to get where the robot sees an image and register that as a count. This is to ensure there is no double counting of images as the robot navigates the maze.",
                            "This project really inspired me to further pursue software development for Robotics, and I have since borrowed the Turtlebot to play around with different algorithms and explore how GenAI can change the way we program robots."],

Momo stands for Modular and Mobile and is a play on the Japanese name for peaches, a hint at the cute design features of this welcoming robot. I joined the team nearing the end of the development of the robot, so my involvement was more on the deployment and showcasing side.",
                            "With the guidance of my seniors who developed the robot, I learnt a lot about the subsystems in an autonomous robot including what‚Äôs required for motor control, computer vision, Lidar navigation systems as well as ROS which ran the whole thing. I took responsibility for mapping and navigating our campus centre building for our university open house.",

Our team decided to think outside the box and explore digital microfluidics. It is a field of study where small amounts of fluids are manipulated electrically. In our application, we wanted to use it to move water droplets and test it against various reagents to analyse its quality.",
                            "With the help of the open-source project OpenDrop we were able to learn the principles of digital microfluidics and get started with our custom PCB design. This project was my first endeavour in PCB design, and I was quick to pick it up with the help of online tutorials.",
                            "This project turned out to be quite the journey due to the lack of information about electrowetting or digital microfluidics, so it took us a few iterations of PCB design, different lubricants, different fluids to get working results."],

The theme was loose and thus we decided to look at it through the lens of daily commutes for the elderly. Here in Singapore, the elderly like to be independent and thus can be seen lugging around trolleys with groceries to and from malls and markets.",
                            "We wanted to help this group elderly folk by designing a foldable electric grocery trolley. This project took us through ideation phases, designs, prototyping and finally a working concept. We learnt about different mechanism and mechanical designing techniques, motors and motor control and CAD Designing.",
                            "We designed a pin-bed mechanism to prevent fragile goods from moving around. We 3D printed these pins and used memory foam as a spring. We integrated folding mechanisms and waterproofed the electronics for ease of use."],

Up until this point I always thought innovation and ideas just come to you, however through this course I learnt how to think up such ideas. This was done through a project where we identified activities and interactions in a public space, created a problem statement and designed a solution.",

We also addressed an issue that was students carrying grocery bags by adding a luggage compartment in the robot.",

They can also manually control the robot and leave behind a message for the next user. We even integrated train timings so that users will know how fast they must walk to catch the next train, giving them some peace of mind."],
